While at [Ancient City Ruby](http://www.ancientcityruby.com), I got to sit down with [Jonathan Cutrell](https://twitter.com/JCutrell) with [Developer Tea](https://developertea.com) to talk a little more about the company culture talk I'd given at [Rocky Mountain Ruby](http://pwnela.com/conference/speaking/rmr2014/2014/09/25/rocky-mountain-ruby-2014.html), [All Things Open](http://pwnela.com/conference/speaking/ato2014/2014/10/23/all-things-open-2014.html), and also at Ancient City Ruby (post forthcoming!).

We also talked about developer stereotypes, diversity efforts, and [MINSWAN](http://blog.emmacodes.com/post/55841830917/minswan) in general.

The first part of our conversation is [here](https://developertea.com/episodes/10477).

The second part is [here](https://developertea.com/episodes/10497).

Have some tea (or some coffee), and take a listen. Then take a listen to more of the [Developer Tea](https://developertea.com) episodes. Even better: [subscribe](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/developer-tea/id955596067?mt=2)!

Make your tea/coffee breaks worthwhile! â˜•âŒšðŸ‘Œ
