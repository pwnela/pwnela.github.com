If you’ve found yourself unable to watch one of the videos of my giving the “Your Company Culture is ‘Awesome’ (But is company culture a lie?)” talk but still want the content, well, you’re in luck. Here is a blog version of my talk.

## Your Company Culture is “Awesome” (But is company culture a lie?)


The phrase “Company Culture” has become completely ubiquitous in our industry and is used to reference anything from having flexible hours to being able to shoot nerf guns at coworkers. What is ultimately a description for the personality and values of a company is now being listed alongside perks and benefits in many job listings. It has become a commodity that is handed to a new hire: “Here you go. This is our culture. It is great. Enjoy!”
￼
What *should* it mean when we rave about our awesome company culture? That the beer Fridays have good attendance? Or that we “work hard but play hard”? Or maybe that we have supportive coworkers and a well defined system for mitigating any coworker-to-coworker squabbles?

If you search any tech job listing site for “culture,” you’ll find countless, endless listings all mentioning culture. But very few listings actually define or describe what the word means to them. I go into more detail about common job listing buzzwords (and potential red flags) in my [Job Listing Minesweeper](LINK) talk I gave at the [Atlanta Alter Conf](LINK) session, but for now, let’s just look at a few claiming “awesome” culture:

> “To succeed, you must be passionate about <Acme Co.>,
> keep up with our daily release cycles,
> and maintain our useful, funny, cool culture during times of immense growth.
> It also doesn't hurt to impress us with your technical chops!”￼

In the rest of the listing, we see no other mention of their culture to be able to determine whether it is indeed “useful,” “funny,” and/or “cool.”

> “Our unique culture deploys a highly integrated model,
> where traders, quantitative analysts, equity analysts and technologists
> work closely together to capitalize on pricing opportunities
> in the options, commodities and futures markets.”

Wat.⤴

> “Please check out our culture and process dev blog posts
> to get a feeling for the <Acme Co.> experience.
> But don't trust us when we say we have the best culture in town.
> Drop by Friday after work for a craft brew
> and try to whip our CTO in ping pong.”

So, I visited their dev blog.⤵

> "Wow, the day has flown by! You’ve finished two stories,
> your pull requests were peer-reviewed and merged,
> and now it’s time to kick back.
> Pull up a stool next to <our keg> and pour yourself a craft brew,
> or grab a seat in front of our huge TVs for some intense Call of Duty.
> Tomorrow we’ll wrap up the current sprint and hold a science fair to
> demonstrate the new hotness we’ve built.
> We hope you’ve enjoyed day[0] – it only gets better from here."

So the "best culture in town" (⤴) sounds *a lot* like⤵

> "We’ve brought together a talented team that is down-to-earth, friendly, and driven to build products that people use and love. We have flexible hours, sponsored company events, and a sweet ping-pong table. Game on!"

Which reminds me... [php ceo tweet].
