Hello from Atlanta. 🍑

I'm Pamela O. Vickers and I am a Ruby developer at [Big Nerd Ranch](http://bignerdranch.com/). I love working with my fellow nerds and coordinating the Big Nerd Ranch intership program.

Since November of 2012, I've been organizing the Atlanta chapter of Rails Girls. We've held two [workshops](http://railsgirls.com/atl), and have been holding [montly meetups](http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls-Atlanta/) since the start of 2013. If you are interested in speaking/volunteering/sponsoring or joining our meetup, please get in touch with me!

When not 💻☕ing, you can find me riding my 🚲 with my 🐩 and my 👦

I like gifs, emojis, and BBC dramas. I guess you could say I'm pretty cool.
