Hello from [Atlanta](http://mailchimp.com/about/atlanta/). 🍑

I'm Pamela O. Vickers, and I'm a Software Engineering Manager at [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com). I've worked previously at [Blue Bottle Coffee](https://bluebottlecoffee.com) and [Big Nerd Ranch](https://www.bignerdranch.com). I love developing, but I love developing developers even more.

Since November of 2012, I've been organizing the Atlanta chapter of Rails Girls. We've held three [workshops](http://railsgirls.com/atl), and have been holding [monthly meetups](http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls-Atlanta/) since the start of 2013. If you are interested in speaking/volunteering/sponsoring or joining our meetup, please get in touch with me! For less Rails-specific-techy-lady fun, there's the monthly [All the Nerdy Ladies](http://allthenerdyladies.com) get-together.

When not 💻☕ing, you can find me riding my 🚲 with my 🐩 and my 👦

I like gifs, emojis, and BBC dramas. I guess you could say I'm pretty cool. 💅
